    <title>Where will this be used in calculus?</title>
    <p>
      Here are several specific calculus examples where working with rational expressions will be useful: 
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          After using rules to differentiate a function (especially the quotient rule) the result is often a rational expression or complex rational expression which needs to be simplified. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When using implicit differentiation the process often involves working with and simplifying complex rational expressions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Integration using the technique called Partial Fractions, involves rational expressions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In Sequences and Series, using the Limit Comparison Test and the Ratio Test often involves working with multiple complex rational expressions.

    <introduction>
    <p>    
The quotient of two polynomials of called a <term>rational expression</term>. For example, lets look at the following rational expression:
    </p>
  
    <me>
      \frac{x^3+3x^2}{x^2+2x-3}
    </me>

    <p>
      Here, <m>x^3+3x^2</m> is the <term>numerator</term> of the rational expression, and <m>x^2+2x-3</m> is the <term>denominator</term>. In this section we will see how to add, subtract, multiply, divide and simplify rational expressions. The rules we will follow are similar to rules regarding working with fractions (such as <m>\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{5}</m>).

    <title>Common factors</title>
    <p>
    Cancelling common factors is one way to simplify a rational expression. Not all expressions have common factors, but it is often useful to check by factoring both the numerator and the denominator. 

EXAMPLE...

The cancelation in example (...) is based on the following rule, which says that if both the numerator an the denominator has the same FACTOR, it can be cancelled. A factor is.... 

Note that what you are canceling must be multiplied (or divided), NOT added or subtracted.
