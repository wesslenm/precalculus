    <title>Welcome!</title>
    <p>
      Welcome to this Precalculus review resource for UTM students.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This resource is intended for students studying differential and/or integral calculus who would like to review relevant precalculus topics. You have most likely seen all or most of the material before, and this resource is meant as a review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the short introductions, have a look at the worked out examples, and try the interactive exercises. Note that for some of the exercises and checkpoints, you can try a new randomized version as many times as you like. Ask the instructors or TAs in your course if you have any questions, or want help.

      A few sections of the text are based on APEX Pre-Calculus, Version 1.0, by Amy Givler Chapman et. al. A copy of that text can be found here: <url href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12b2cwH7afXhsYSDb-QCWKmFK2QCq7UfY/view">APEX Pre-Calculus.</url> The text has been modified, built upon, and interactive exercises have been added.
