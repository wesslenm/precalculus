  "body": " Rational Expressions     Simplify and re-work rational expressions.    Simplify and work with fractions.    Add, subtract, multiply and divide rational expressions.    Simplify and rewrite complex fractions and complex rational expressions.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Here are several specific calculus examples where working with rational expressions will be useful:     After using rules to differentiate a function (especially the quotient rule) the result is often a rational expression or complex rational expression which needs to be simplified.    When using implicit differentiation the process often involves working with and simplifying complex rational expressions.    Integration using the technique called Partial Fractions, involves rational expressions.    In Sequences and Series, using the Limit Comparison Test and the Ratio Test often involves working with multiple complex rational expressions.       The quotient of two polynomials is called a rational expression . For example, lets look at the following rational expression:   Here, is the numerator , and is the denominator . In this section we will see how to add, subtract, multiply, divide and simplify rational expressions. The rules we will follow are similar to rules regarding working with fractions (such as for example simplifying ).    Common factors  Cancelling common factors is one way to simplify a rational expression. Not all expressions have common factors, but it is often useful to check by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.  A factor is part of an expression which is multiplied by the rest of the expression.   Common factor   Simplify the rational epression          Let's factor both the numerator and the denominator to see if there are any common factors. and Next, lets look at the expression in the question and cancel any common factors:  . So, in the end, we see that       Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified       The cancelation in is based on the following rule, which says that if both the numerator and the denominator has the same FACTOR , it can be cancelled. Note that what you are canceling must be multiplied (or divided) by the rest of the numerator and denominator, NOT added or subtracted.   Rule  For any real numbers , , and where and , it is true that and This is true both if , , and are be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.    Common Error  In general, the following are not true.     Note that can be useful in ``both directions''. Sometimes it is useful to multiply both numerator and denominator in a fraction. You can do that, as long as you multiply both numerator and denominator by the same expression. We will see examples of that later.    Simplify the rational expression in the form  Answer:  and                  Note: If you are unsure of how to work with exponents, you could have a look at section before working on .   For each of the following, determine if the statement is True or False, for all real numbers , , ? Whenever there is division, assume that all denominators are non-zero. Make sure to try these yourself first before looking at the answers!    (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)      1-False, 2-False, 3-True, 4-True, 5-False      Multiplying and dividing rational expressions  To multiplying rational expressions we use the same ideas and rules as when multiplying numerical fractions. The numerators are multipled, and the denominators are multiplied. For example   Sometimes it might be worth simplifying the result, or perhaps simplifying before multiplying (if it's easy enough to do so).   Technique  To multiply two rational expressions, multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the product. Then multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the product. where , , and could be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.    Multiplying rational expressions   Multiply the rational expressions and simplify the answer:          Multiply numerators separately, then denominators separately, as described in .   Note that it is important to use brackets, to show that all of is multiplied by all of (and similarly for the denominator). Next, expend the brackets and simplify:   There is no further simplification that can be made. So the answer is       Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.

Take the reciprocal of the denominator, then muliply. For example    Technique  To divide two rational expressions, multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator: where , , and could be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.   can be writen in more detail:   Dividing rational expressions   Divide the rational expressions and simplify the answer:          Multiply numerators separately, then denominators separately, as described in .   Note that it is important to use brackets, to show that all of is multiplied by all of (and similarly for the denominator). Next, expand the brackets and simplify:  . There is no further simplification that can be made. So the answer is       Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.    You might want to do a preview before submitting your answer to be certain it has been entered correctly.   Reciprocal              Adding and Subtracting rational expressions  Let's start by looking at a numerical example of adding two fractions, for example . To add fractions, we need to use a common denominator, then add the resulting numerators. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, so let's use that as the common denominator in this case:   The general steps for adding rational expressions are the same. Also, the technique is the same for adding and for subtracting.   Technique  To add or subtract two rational expressions:  Find a common denominator. (It may be useful to factor the denominators.)  Multiply each rational expression to change the denominators to the common denominator.  Add or subtract the numerators.  Simplify if needed.      Subtracting rational expressions   Subtract the rational expressions and simplify the answer:        We need find a common denominator. We could use any common denominator. For example we could simply use but this means we need to expand these brackets and it would lead to high answers in the answer, which may be difficult to simplify. It is often more efficient to use the Least Common Decominator (LCD). To find the LCD, we first facor both denominators:    This means the LCD is   Next, multiply the first rational expression by and the second rational expression by so that both are on the same common denominator. Note that multiplying by is the same as multiplying by 1. It does not change the value of the expression, it just re-writes it in a different format.  . So the answer is It is ok to leave the answer in this format, or to expand the denominator (or factor the numerator if you prefer).      Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.    You might want to do a preview before submitting your answer to be certain it has been entered correctly.   First you will need to get a common denominator by finding the least common multiple.  The common denominator is but you will need to put parenthesis around the denominator so that you divide it all.              Find the least common denominator (LCD) of the rational expressions:  LCD:        The factors of the denominators are    Hence, the LCD is .         Perform the indicated operation. Note that the denominators are the same. Simplify the result, if possible.  Answer:  help(entering your answer)        The denominators are equal. Add the numerators. Factor and reduce.         Complex rational expressions  A rational expression that contains a rational expression within the numerator or denominator (or both), is called a complex rational expression . To simplify a complex rational expression, start by simplifying the numberator, then the denominator, and after that is done you can simplify the overall expression.   Simplifying a complex rational expression   Simplify the complex rational expression:          Simplify the numerator to make it a single fraction:  . Simplify the denominator to make it a single fraction:  . Now we are ready to simplify the complex rational expression. Remember that to divide by a rationl expression, multiply by the reciprocal (see ).   There is no further simplification that can be made. So the final answer is     Let's summarize the steps we took in :   Technique  To simplify complex rational expressions:  Simplify the numerator to make it a single rational expression.  Simplify the denominator to make it a single rational expression.  Divide the two expressions, by multiplying of the reciprocal of the denominator (as in ).  Simplify if needed.       Simplify the complex fraction in the form .

You are strongly encouraged to try the examples first on your own, before looking at the worked solutions.    A complex rational expression with division   Simplify the expression:          Consider the overall expression. We can use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:   Now simplify the numerator to make it a single fraction:   Now we have a rational expression where the numerator is a rational expression: Again, we use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:  . The final answer is      A complex rational expression with two variables   Simplify the expression as much as possible. Assume that any factors you cancel are not zero.          Both the numerator and denominator are rational expressions. The numerator is already a single rational expression, but the denminator is not, so let's rewrite the denominator on a common denominator: We can use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:   Now we have a rational expression divided by a rational expression, so we multiply by the reciprocal:  . We can cancel a common factor of :  . We could make a note that . (This is because on the left side, can not be 0 since it would result in division by 0). However, the statement of the question said that we can assume that any factors we cancel are not zero. The question also asked to simplify as much as possible. Let's check for more common factors: .  Again, we can assume that any factors we cancel are not zero, so we do not need to write . The final answer is       Exercises  Note: In all exercises, assume that any factor you cancel is not zero (as in Example ).  1.   Simplify the rational expression.

  "title": "Exponential Rules",
  "body": " Exponential Rules     Use exponent rules to simplify and re-work expressions.    Simplify roots\/radicals without a calculator.    Avoid common errors regarding exponents and radicals.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Rewriting and simplifying exponentials and radicals is usefully in most computational areas of mathematics, including calculus. Here are two specific calculus examples:   When differentiating or integrating a power function (or a combination of power functions), rewrite each term as a single power before differentiating or integrating. For example, rewriting as will make it easier to differentiate or integrate.    After using rules to differentiate a function (for example the product rule, quotient rule or chain rule) the result is often a messy complicated looking expression which needs to be simplified.        As an instroduction, we can think of integer exponents as repeated multiplication. If we want to find the volume of a cube, we can shorten the notation by using exponents. To find the volume of a cube with side length , we would multiply by itself three times to get length times width times height. We can write . Here, the exponent tells us how many times to do the multiplication. The concept can later be exanded to include non-integer values of the exponent . But starting by looking at integer exponents can give us an intuitive idea of what exponentials are and how to work with them.    The First Rules  The first exponent rule we will examine is   Here, the first term, tells us to multiply by itself times and the second term tells us to multiply it times. Together, that says we need to multiply a total of times, giving us . As an example, .    Use the properties of exponents to simplify the following          We add the exponents as follows        Note that is true for all real numbers and (they do not need to be integers), and all positive values of .  Next, let's look at   This rule builds off of our previous rule. If we have , rule tells us that we really have . We went from having multiplied 5 times to having multiplied only 3 terms, meaning we have removed two of the multiplications. We removed a multiplication through a division:   A negative exponent tells us we have division rather than multiplication.  A more general version of the rule is the following: We can see this from previous rules: Again, all of the above is true for all real numbers and , and all positive values of .    Evaluate:   Note: Your answer should be completely simplified. Unsimplified answers will not be accepted.              Simplify the following expression, and write your answer using only positive exponents.   Note that you may have to be careful with grouping parenthesis in this problem; 1\/2r is not the same as 1\/(2r).        We use the properties of exponents to help us here, remembering that          Rewrite the following using a single exponent.  for =            If there are several different base numbers we need to collect those with the same base, as in the following example.   Simplifying exponents with several bases  Simplify the expression .        We can multiply the constant coefficients (11 and 7):   Next, we can use rule to simplify powers of , and then use again for powers of .   The final result is:       Simplify the expression:  =              Roots  Before we continue with more exponent rules, let's look at the inverse function, or how to ``undo'' an exponent. These are root functions. A square root ``undoes'' squaring and a cube root ``undoes'' cubing. In general, we have   and   (Both of the above are examples of rule , which we will look more at soon.)  Often, you will see written as . Mathematicians call the radical form and the exponential form. Both have the same meaning. Anytime you see , you can replace it with and vice versa. Even more generally, we have: which is true for all real numbers and , and all positive values of .  Sometimes it is useful to be able to simplify radicals or fractional exponents by hand. Let's take a look at how we can evaluate these types of terms.   Evaluating radicals  Evaluate without using a calculator.       As first glance, this looks like we won't be able to do much with it. However, we can use our exponent rules to help us evaluate it. We can rewrite this as or as . We prefer the second version. With the first version we would have , but this is tricky to deal with by hand because not many people have perfect cubes memorized, so we would need to factor . If we use the second version, , we would start by finding the cube root of 8. When we factor, we get , which show us that . This gives us , so our final answer is       Evaluate the following without a calculator. Simplify your answers as much as possible.  (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)                        SOLUTION (a) . (b) .

Answer:  and                    Find the product and express your answer in the form  , , , and are all integers and  Answer:  ,  ,  , and                              More exponential rules  The next rule we will discuss is     This rule builds directly off of our first rule as well. As a example when and are integers, tells us we need to multiply by itself times. Since multiplies by itself times, tells us to multiply by itself a total of times. For example,   We can also use this rule when there is a product or quotient inside the parentheses, but not if there is an addition or subtraction.      However,      Double exponents  Simplify and     and    Using the rules we have seen above, we have that: and     Exponents and addition  Are and equal of different?  They are different. in general. We can test this by chosing some values for and , then checking what the expressions are. For example, let and . Then and so they are not equal.    Addition inside a bracket   Simpliy the expression .    To simplify we could rewrite it as and distribute. Or it would be even faster to use rule .

Simplify your answer as much as possible, and enter your answer as a fraction.  =              Simplify and write the following in exponential notation.

Write your answer using radical notation if necessary.  Help:              Summary  The rules we have just seen will all be quite handy in calculus (and many other fields of mathematics, of course). In both integral and differential calculus, we will have rules that work well when we have a power function (a function of the form ), but won't work for other forms of functions. By being able to rewrite functions like , in power function form ( in this case), other calculations will be simplified.  Our rules are summarized below.   Exponential Rules  The following are true for all positive numbers and , and any real numbers and :                                                             Notation  Suppose is any positive number , and and are integers, with . Then:             It is important to know mathematical rules and how to use them, but it is also important to know which `rules' are not true. Here are a few common errors:   Common Errors  The following expressions are not equal, in general.          Additional Examples  Let's look at a few examples of working with exponent rules. The examples use one or several of the rules we have seen above.   You are strongly encouraged to try the examples first on your own, before looking at the worked solutions.    Simplifying exponents   Simplify          Anytime we simplify, we need to remember our order of operations. The order of operations tells us to start with terms that are inside of parentheses, so we will work on simplifying the fraction before we worry about the exponent on the outside. First, we will write everything using exponents rather than radicals so we can use our exponent rules more easily in the rest of the problem.   Next, we will eliminate the fraction by using negative exponents on the terms that are in the denominator. After rewriting, we will combine any like terms.   Now that everything inside the parentheses is simplified as much as possible, we will use our third exponent rule to finish simplifying. Rule says that . We need to make sure we distribute the exponent that is outside of the parentheses to each term inside of the parentheses. This give us   So, in the end, we get that      Simplifying exponents involving addition  Simplify         Note: Be careful to avoid the common error above.  We'll start by focusing on the terms inside the parentheses and rewriting all radicals (roots) as exponents. This gives us There is nothing that we can simplify inside the parentheses. We now need to apply the exponent on the outside of the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have two terms that are added, so we can't apply an exponent rule here. We will need to rewrite and then expand. . We don't have any like terms, so we can't simplify any further. We could rewrite slightly, but this is a matter of personal preference. We have three other ways we could write this final answer. We could use exponent rules to rewrite the middle term since , giving us . We could also use radicals and write either or . All of these four answers are fully simplified, and are equally valid. Probably the most common form is       Mixed Exercises  1. Look at each of the \"common errors\" listed above. For each one, explain why it is not true. Replace the letters with numbers (choose some numbers!), to check that often the two sides are not equal, similar to the solution of .  2.
