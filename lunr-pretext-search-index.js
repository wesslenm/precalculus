  "title": "Rational Expressions",
  "body": " Rational Expressions     Simplify and re-work rational expressions.    Simplify and work with fractions.    Add, subtract, multiply and divide rational expressions.    Simplify and rewrite complex fractions and complex rational expressions.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Here are several specific calculus examples where working with rational expressions will be useful:     After using rules to differentiate a function (especially the quotient rule) the result is often a rational expression or complex rational expression which needs to be simplified.    When using implicit differentiation the process often involves working with and simplifying complex rational expressions.    Integration using the technique called Partial Fractions, involves rational expressions.    In Sequences and Series, using the Limit Comparison Test and the Ratio Test often involves working with multiple complex rational expressions.       The quotient of two polynomials is called a rational expression . For example, lets look at the following rational expression:   Here, is the numerator , and is the denominator . In this section we will see how to add, subtract, multiply, divide and simplify rational expressions. The rules we will follow are similar to rules regarding working with fractions (such as for example simplifying ).    Common factors  Cancelling common factors is one way to simplify a rational expression. Not all expressions have common factors, but it is often useful to check by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.  A factor is part of an expression which is multiplied by the rest of the expression.   Common factor   Simplify the rational epression          Let's factor both the numerator and the denominator to see if there are any common factors. and Next, lets look at the expression in the question and cancel any common factors:  . So, in the end, we see that       Simplify the rational expression. Answer:    No correct answer specified       The cancelation in is based on the following rule, which says that if both the numerator and the denominator has the same FACTOR , it can be cancelled. Note that what you are canceling must be multiplied (or divided) by the rest of the numerator and denominator, NOT added or subtracted.   Rule  For any real numbers , , and where and , it is true that and This is true both if , , and are be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.    Common Error  In general, the following are not true.     Note that can be useful in ``both directions''. Sometimes it is useful to multiply both numerator and denominator in a fraction. You can do that, as long as you multiply both numerator and denominator by the same expression. We will see examples of that later.    Simplify the rational expression in the form  Answer:  and                  Note: If you are unsure of how to work with exponents, you could have a look at section before working on .   For each of the following, determine if the statement is True or False, for all real numbers , , ? Whenever there is division, assume that all denominators are non-zero. Make sure to try these yourself first before looking at the answers!    (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)   (True or False?)      1-False, 2-False, 3-True, 4-True, 5-False      Multiplying and dividing rational expressions  To multiplying rational expressions we use the same ideas and rules as when multiplying numerical fractions. The numerators are multipled, and the denominators are multiplied. For example   Sometimes it might be worth simplifying the result, or perhaps simplifying before multiplying (if it's easy enough to do so).   Technique  To multiply two rational expressions, multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the product. Then multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the product. where , , and could be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.    Multiplying rational expressions   Multiply the rational expressions and simplify the answer:          Multiply numerators separately, then denominators separately, as described in .   Note that it is important to use brackets, to show that all of is multiplied by all of (and similarly for the denominator). Next, expend the brackets and simplify:   There is no further simplification that can be made. So the answer is       Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.

Take the reciprocal of the denominator, then muliply. For example    Technique  To divide two rational expressions, multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator: where , , and could be constants (numbers) and\/or expressions involving variables.   can be writen in more detail:   Dividing rational expressions   Divide the rational expressions and simplify the answer:          Multiply numerators separately, then denominators separately, as described in .   Note that it is important to use brackets, to show that all of is multiplied by all of (and similarly for the denominator). Next, expand the brackets and simplify:  . There is no further simplification that can be made. So the answer is       Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.    You might want to do a preview before submitting your answer to be certain it has been entered correctly.   Reciprocal              Adding and Subtracting rational expressions  Let's start by looking at a numerical example of adding two fractions, for example . To add fractions, we need to use a common denominator, then add the resulting numerators. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, so let's use that as the common denominator in this case:   The general steps for adding rational expressions are the same. Also, the technique is the same for adding and for subtracting.   Technique  To add or subtract two rational expressions:  Find a common denominator. (It may be useful to factor the denominators.)  Multiply each rational expression to change the denominators to the common denominator.  Add or subtract the numerators.  Simplify if needed.      Subtracting rational expressions   Subtract the rational expressions and simplify the answer:        We need find a common denominator. We could use any common denominator. For example we could simply use but this means we need to expand these brackets and it would lead to high answers in the answer, which may be difficult to simplify. It is often more efficient to use the Least Common Decominator (LCD). To find the LCD, we first facor both denominators:    This means the LCD is   Next, multiply the first rational expression by and the second rational expression by so that both are on the same common denominator. Note that multiplying by is the same as multiplying by 1. It does not change the value of the expression, it just re-writes it in a different format.  . So the answer is It is ok to leave the answer in this format, or to expand the denominator (or factor the numerator if you prefer).      Evaluate the following and express your answer as a single fraction.    You might want to do a preview before submitting your answer to be certain it has been entered correctly.   First you will need to get a common denominator by finding the least common multiple.  The common denominator is but you will need to put parenthesis around the denominator so that you divide it all.              Find the least common denominator (LCD) of the rational expressions:  LCD:        The factors of the denominators are    Hence, the LCD is .         Perform the indicated operation. Note that the denominators are the same. Simplify the result, if possible.  Answer:  help(entering your answer)        The denominators are equal. Add the numerators. Factor and reduce.         Complex rational expressions  A rational expression that contains a rational expression within the numerator or denominator (or both), is called a complex rational expression . To simplify a complex rational expression, start by simplifying the numberator, then the denominator, and after that is done you can simplify the overall expression.   Simplifying a complex rational expression   Simplify the complex rational expression:          Simplify the numerator to make it a single fraction:  . Simplify the denominator to make it a single fraction:  . Now we are ready to simplify the complex rational expression. Remember that to divide by a rationl expression, multiply by the reciprocal (see ).   There is no further simplification that can be made. So the final answer is     Let's summarize the steps we took in :   Technique  To simplify complex rational expressions:  Simplify the numerator to make it a single rational expression.  Simplify the denominator to make it a single rational expression.  Divide the two expressions, by multiplying of the reciprocal of the denominator (as in ).  Simplify if needed.       Simplify the complex fraction in the form .

You are strongly encouraged to try the examples first on your own, before looking at the worked solutions.    A complex rational expression with division   Simplify the expression:          Consider the overall expression. We can use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:   Now simplify the numerator to make it a single fraction:   Now we have a rational expression where the numerator is a rational expression: Again, we use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:  . The final answer is      A complex rational expression with two variables   Simplify the expression as much as possible. Assume that any factors you cancel are not zero.          Both the numerator and denominator are rational expressions. The numerator is already a single rational expression, but the denminator is not, so let's rewrite the denominator on a common denominator: We can use to rewrite this into a simpler expression:   Now we have a rational expression divided by a rational expression, so we multiply by the reciprocal:  . We can cancel a common factor of :  . We could make a note that . (This is because on the left side, can not be 0 since it would result in division by 0). However, the statement of the question said that we can assume that any factors we cancel are not zero. The question also asked to simplify as much as possible. Let's check for more common factors: .  Again, we can assume that any factors we cancel are not zero, so we do not need to write . The final answer is       Exercises  Note: In all exercises, assume that any factor you cancel is not zero (as in Example ).     Simplify the rational expression.

  "body": " Dividing polynomials     Use long division to divide a polynomial by another polynomial.    Interpret the results of long division of polynomials.    Validate results (check answer).      Where will this be used in calculus?  Some specific examples of where long division of polynomials is used are:     Long division of polynomials can be useful when looking for certain types of asymptotes, which is important in graph sketching.    Long division of polynomials can be useful when factoring polynomials, for example when using the integration technique `partial fractions'.       You may remember long division of large numbers, for example 5781 divided by 25. In this section we review how the technique of long division can be used to divide a polynomial by another polynomial.    Notation  Suppose we want to divide the polynomial by . (We will actually do this later in .) The notation we will use is as follows:                              If dividing the polynomial by , then is called the dividend and is called the divisor . The answer to the division is called the quotient . When done, the quotient will appear at the top of the long division:      quotient      divisor  dividend    Sometimes there is a remainder if the dividend is not evenly divided by the divisor. For an example see .    Long division of polynomials  Let's start with a small example. Let's divide by . (You may be able to easily find out the answer by factoring , but instead let's practice long division on this simple example.)   Polynomial long division   Use long division to divide the polynomial by .         Step 1.  Setup:                          Step 2.  Question: times what gives ?  Answer: . So write at the top. ( will be part of the final answer.)                          Step 3.  Multiply (the divisor) by .   . Write this under the dividend.                                     Step 4.  Subtract from .  Bring down the .                                              Step 5.  Now repeat the process.  Question: times what equals ?  Answer: . Therefore write at the top.                                              Step 6.  Multiply (the divisor) by .   . Write this under the dividend.                                                         Step 7.  Subtract from .                                                                    Step 8.  Now we read off the answer. The answer is .     If the last step in the long division is not zero, we say that there is a remainder.  When a polynomial is divided by a polynomial , with quotient and remainder , then the result can be written in the form:    Interpreting the result   Suppose Nika has used long division to divide by .

Find the quotient and the remainder (if there is one).     Quotient: .  Remainder: 4    Here is the worked out long division. In \"Solution 2\" you will find a breakdown of all the steps within the same long division.                                                                                                    This means that: Quotient: .  Remainder: 4    This is a detailed solution with the steps outlined. Let's follow a similar procedure to above.  Step 1. Setup:                              Step 2.

  "body": " Exponential Rules     Use exponent rules to simplify and re-work expressions.    Simplify roots\/radicals without a calculator.    Avoid common errors regarding exponents and radicals.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Rewriting and simplifying exponentials and radicals is usefully in most computational areas of mathematics, including calculus. Here are two specific calculus examples:   When differentiating or integrating a power function (or a combination of power functions), rewrite each term as a single power before differentiating or integrating. For example, rewriting as will make it easier to differentiate or integrate.    After using rules to differentiate a function (for example the product rule, quotient rule or chain rule) the result is often a messy complicated looking expression which needs to be simplified.        As an instroduction, we can think of integer exponents as repeated multiplication. If we want to find the volume of a cube, we can shorten the notation by using exponents. To find the volume of a cube with side length , we would multiply by itself three times to get length times width times height. We can write . Here, the exponent tells us how many times to do the multiplication. The concept can later be exanded to include non-integer values of the exponent . But starting by looking at integer exponents can give us an intuitive idea of what exponentials are and how to work with them.    The First Rules  The first exponent rule we will examine is   Here, the first term, tells us to multiply by itself times and the second term tells us to multiply it times. Together, that says we need to multiply a total of times, giving us . As an example, .    Use the properties of exponents to simplify the following          We add the exponents as follows        Note that is true for all real numbers and (they do not need to be integers), and all positive values of .  Next, let's look at   This rule builds off of our previous rule. If we have , rule tells us that we really have . We went from having multiplied 5 times to having multiplied only 3 terms, meaning we have removed two of the multiplications. We removed a multiplication through a division:   A negative exponent tells us we have division rather than multiplication.  A more general version of the rule is the following: We can see this from previous rules: Again, all of the above is true for all real numbers and , and all positive values of .    Evaluate:   Note: Your answer should be completely simplified. Unsimplified answers will not be accepted.              Simplify the following expression, and write your answer using only positive exponents.   Note that you may have to be careful with grouping parenthesis in this problem; 1\/2t is not the same as 1\/(2t).        We use the properties of exponents to help us here, remembering that          Rewrite the following using a single exponent.  for =            If there are several different base numbers we need to collect those with the same base, as in the following example.   Simplifying exponents with several bases  Simplify the expression .        We can multiply the constant coefficients (11 and 7):   Next, we can use rule to simplify powers of , and then use again for powers of .   The final result is:       Simplify the expression:  =              Roots  Before we continue with more exponent rules, let's look at the inverse function, or how to ``undo'' an exponent. These are root functions. A square root ``undoes'' squaring and a cube root ``undoes'' cubing. In general, we have   and   (Both of the above are examples of rule , which we will look more at soon.)  Often, you will see written as . Mathematicians call the radical form and the exponential form. Both have the same meaning. Anytime you see , you can replace it with and vice versa. Even more generally, we have: which is true for all real numbers and , and all positive values of .  Sometimes it is useful to be able to simplify radicals or fractional exponents by hand. Let's take a look at how we can evaluate these types of terms.   Evaluating radicals  Evaluate without using a calculator.       As first glance, this looks like we won't be able to do much with it. However, we can use our exponent rules to help us evaluate it. We can rewrite this as or as . We prefer the second version. With the first version we would have , but this is tricky to deal with by hand because not many people have perfect cubes memorized, so we would need to factor . If we use the second version, , we would start by finding the cube root of 8. When we factor, we get , which show us that . This gives us , so our final answer is       Evaluate the following without a calculator. Simplify your answers as much as possible.  (a)   (b)   (c)   (d)                        SOLUTION (a) . (b) .

Answer:  and                    Find the product and express your answer in the form  , , , and are all integers and  Answer:  ,  ,  , and                              More exponential rules  The next rule we will discuss is     This rule builds directly off of our first rule as well. As a example when and are integers, tells us we need to multiply by itself times. Since multiplies by itself times, tells us to multiply by itself a total of times. For example,   We can also use this rule when there is a product or quotient inside the parentheses, but not if there is an addition or subtraction.      However,      Double exponents  Simplify and     and    Using the rules we have seen above, we have that: and     Exponents and addition  Are and equal of different?  They are different. in general. We can test this by chosing some values for and , then checking what the expressions are. For example, let and . Then and so they are not equal.    Addition inside a bracket   Simpliy the expression .    To simplify we could rewrite it as and distribute. Or it would be even faster to use rule .         To simplify we can rewrite it as and distribute.        Evaluate the following expression without using a calculator. Simplify your answer as much as possible, and enter your answer as a fraction.  =              Simplify and write the following in exponential notation. If   then   and                    Simplify the expression:  =              Simplify. Assume that all expressions under radicals represent nonnegative numbers.    Write your answer using radical notation if necessary.  Help:              Summary  The rules we have just seen will all be quite handy in calculus (and many other fields of mathematics, of course). In both integral and differential calculus, we will have rules that work well when we have a power function (a function of the form ), but won't work for other forms of functions. By being able to rewrite functions like , in power function form ( in this case), other calculations will be simplified.  Our rules are summarized below.   Exponential Rules  The following are true for all positive numbers and , and any real numbers and :                                                             Notation  Suppose is any positive number , and and are integers, with . Then:             It is important to know mathematical rules and how to use them, but it is also important to know which `rules' are not true. Here are a few common errors:   Common Errors  The following expressions are not equal, in general.          Additional Examples  Let's look at a few examples of working with exponent rules. The examples use one or several of the rules we have seen above.   You are strongly encouraged to try the examples first on your own, before looking at the worked solutions.    Simplifying exponents   Simplify          Anytime we simplify, we need to remember our order of operations. The order of operations tells us to start with terms that are inside of parentheses, so we will work on simplifying the fraction before we worry about the exponent on the outside. First, we will write everything using exponents rather than radicals so we can use our exponent rules more easily in the rest of the problem.   Next, we will eliminate the fraction by using negative exponents on the terms that are in the denominator. After rewriting, we will combine any like terms.   Now that everything inside the parentheses is simplified as much as possible, we will use our third exponent rule to finish simplifying. Rule says that . We need to make sure we distribute the exponent that is outside of the parentheses to each term inside of the parentheses. This give us   So, in the end, we get that      Simplifying exponents involving addition  Simplify         Note: Be careful to avoid the common error above.  We'll start by focusing on the terms inside the parentheses and rewriting all radicals (roots) as exponents. This gives us There is nothing that we can simplify inside the parentheses. We now need to apply the exponent on the outside of the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have two terms that are added, so we can't apply an exponent rule here. We will need to rewrite and then expand. . We don't have any like terms, so we can't simplify any further. We could rewrite slightly, but this is a matter of personal preference.

Use the right angled triangle definitions and the general definitions of the 6 trigonometric functions, and interchange between the two.    Be familiar with basic relationships between trigonometric functions.    Evaluate the 6 trigonometric functions without a calculator, for common angles such as those listed in .      Where will this be used in calculus?  Trigonometric functions are used extensively throughout calculus. Being able to work with, and evaluate, trigonometric functions is essential in many applications. Here are a few specific examples:     Trigonometric functions are used in many modeling contexts, for example when modeling wave motions.    A technique called trigonometric substitution allows us to solve integration problems such as for example .    Optimization problems sometimes involve trigonometric relationships. For example, maximizing the area of a triangle given certain side lengths requires an understanding of trigonometric functions.       In this section, we will work with trigonometric functions. We will examine relationships between the 6 trigonometric functions and will discuss how to evaluate them for commonly used inputs.    Angle notation  THIS PART NEEDS IMAGES  In calculus, we will mostly use radians to measure angles. This is because several formulas and techniques in calculus are much easier to work with when using radians (compared to degrees). If you are more familiar with angles measured in degrees, you may want to start by using this conversion chart. However, it is useful to develop a feel for radian measures (rather than converting to degrees each time).   Correspondence between radian and degree measures in some common angles.    Degree  Radian    0  0                                               Study tip:   Use radians as much as possible and try to develop a feel for their size. Try to develop a feel for how large for example radians is, withough needing to convert it to degrees. Use degrees as little as possible (or not at all) when you study calculus. If you use a calculator to check your answers, make sure it is set to radian mode.   An angle placed on the coordinate system is in standard position when its vertex is at the origin and its initial side is on the positive -axis. See . A positive angle is in the counterclockwise direction. A negative angle is in the clockwise direction.   Angles in standard position  Angles in standard position   Angles in standard position.    The unit circle can be used to define trigonometric functions. The unit circle is a circle with centre at the origin, and radius 1, as shown in . The point in is the terminal point . The terminal point is defined as the point where the terminal side of an angle (in standard position) intersects the unit circle. The and values of the point will be important in the definitions of the trigonometric functions.   A point on the unit circle  A point on the unit circle   A point on the unit circle.

The point desired is where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. Use geometric ideas to determine and in a manner similar to what was done in earlier sections of this course.                                                                   We often (but not always) use Greek letters to represent angles. For example, (theta), (alpha) and (beta) are commonly used to represent angles.   Greek letters  For reference, here is a list of the names of some Greek letters commonly used in calculus, in case you are interested. (This is not a full list of the Greek alphabet.)     Definitions  We will focus on six trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent. It is important to be familiar with their definitions, both in terms of right angled triangles, and in terms of angles in standard position in a circle.   Definitions of trigonometric functions - right angled triangles  Consider a right angled triangle, where one of the non-right angles is . This means . Then the trigonometric functions are defined as follows:     Sine: Opposite \/ Hypothenuse    Cosine: Adjacent \/ Hypothenuse    Tangent: Opposite \/ Adjacent        Study tip:   You should memorize all defitions of trigonometric functions, if you don't know them already. It is important to know both the definitions in terms of right angled triangles AND the definitions in terms of the circle.    Definitions of trigonometric functions - general definition  Let be any angle in standard position in a circle centered at .                       Trigonometric functions - relationships  The following relationships are all important.                             Study tip:   You should take the time to memorize all of the listed relationships between trigonometric functions, if you don't know them already.    Definitions of , and Use the listed relationships between trigonomtric functions to find the definitions of secant, cosecant and cotangent. Write down lists of definitions first in terms of right angled triangles, then in terms of in a circle.  We know that . Therefore, in terms of right angled triangles, . Now do the same for secant and cotangent.  In terms of , we see that . Now do the same for secant and cotangent.   Simplifying   Write the expression in terms of only sine and cosine, and simplify as much as possible.   .   Re-write each of the trigonometric functions in terms of and then simplify. Remember that your final answer should not use any of the other trigonometric functions, only and\/or             Evaluating using special triangles  Being able to evaluate trigonometric functions for common angles will be important in many contexts and examples in calculus. There are several ways to do this. One of the easest is to start with two special triangles.

Determine symmetries of trigonometric functions.    Determine amplitude, period and phase shift.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Trigonometric functions are used to model many phenomena of a periodic nature, and are therefore an important tool in calculus as well. Graphs can be used to get an overview of a function, or to recall specific information easily. Some examples are:     Finding the area between curves or the volume of certain solids is an important part of integral calculus. Being familiar with trigonometric graphs is essential.    Analyzing amplitude, period and phase shift of a periodic wave is imprtant for understanding the characterisics of the functions and of any situation that is modeled.

Use properties of inverse trigonometric functions to simplify\/evaluate expressions.    Use correct notation and avoid common mistakes regarding inverse trigonometric functions.      Where will this be used in calculus?  Inverse trigonometric functions (and evaluating them) is present in all areas of calculus, such as derivatives, integrals, limits, Taylor series expansion etc. Here are a few examples in calculus and beyond:     Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions appear in physics, particularly in problems involving angles of motion, such as kinematics (certain types of motion), optics (refraction angles) and electrical engineering (arctan functions appear in circuit analysis).    Inverse trigonometric functions are used in robotics and computer animation, for example in inverse kinematics used to control robot arms and other manipulators to perform tasks.    The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are frequently used in implicit differentiation and chain rule applications.    Inverse trigonometric functions often appear in integrals involving rational expressions, especially when the denominator is of a certain form.       In this section we study inverse trigonometric functions. Inverse trigonometric are useful in solving problems involving trigonometric functions, and they are also useful as an additional set of functions (and graphs) which can be used to model and analyze various phenomena.    Arcsine - the inverse sine function  Let's start with a reminder regarding inverse function in general:  A function has an inverse if and only if is one-to-one. An equavalent way of saying this is that a function has an inverse if and only if the graph of passes the horizontal line test (meaning, no horizontal line crosses the curve more than once).  Looking at the graph of , we see that it does NOT pass the horizontal line test, so therefore is not invertible.  INSERT GRAPH  However, this difficulty can be solved by restricting the domain. If we restrict the domain of to the interval , then the restricted function is one-to-one. We call the inverse of the restricted sine function, the inverse sine function  .

INSERT GRAPH  If we restrict the domain of in the same way as (namely ), it is still not oe-to-one. However, we can choose a different interval. The interval we will restrict to, to make it one-to-one is . Then the restricted function is one-to-one. We call the inverse of the restricted cosine function, the inverse cosine function  .
